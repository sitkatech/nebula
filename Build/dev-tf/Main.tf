# =============================================================================
# Nebula dev-environment infrastructure (Terraform)
# =============================================================================
# Stands up the DEV support resources local devcontainers use -- principally
# the dev Key Vault the API reads at runtime when `KeyVaultName` is set (see
# .devcontainer/.env and Nebula.API/Program.cs AddAzureKeyVault). This is a
# SEPARATE, lighter stack from the deployed qa/prod infra in the root
# nebula.tf.
#
# Auth model: RBAC (enable_rbac_authorization). A developer's `az login`
# identity reads secrets via DefaultAzureCredential once their AAD group holds
# "Key Vault Secrets User" (var.devReaderGroupObjectId below).
#
# Deliberately smaller than wave-runup's equivalent:
#   - No dev storage account or blob container. NebulaConfiguration declares no
#     AzureBlobStorageConnectionString and the API never touches blob storage;
#     the only storage in this app is GeoServer's Azure File share, which is a
#     deployed-environment concern, not a dev one.
#   - No dev user-assigned identity. wave-runup needs one so its dev workloads
#     can reach blob storage; nebula's devcontainer authenticates as the
#     developer, so there is nothing for an identity to do.
